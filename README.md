# PrivateVPN-TUI

## Scrapes countries and cities directly from "https://privatevpn.com/serverlist"

**Note:** *PrivateVPN will need to be installed and configured (i.e. username pass entered into "privatvpn.login" file). Change paths to your own installation directory.*

Text user interface for Linux terminal, created to make connecting to a server easier.

Just pick a country, then a city and it will automatically connect, as long as PrivateVPN has been configured properly.
