# PrivateVPN-TUI

Note: PrivateVPN will need to be installed and configured (i.e. username pass entered into "privatvpn.login" file). Change paths to your own installation directory.

Text user interface for Linux terminal, created to make connecting to a server easier.

Just pick a country, then a city and it will automatically connect, as long as PrivateVPN has been configured properly.
